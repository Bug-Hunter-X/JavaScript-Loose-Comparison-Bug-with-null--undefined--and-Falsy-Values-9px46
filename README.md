# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparisons (==) when dealing with null, undefined, and other falsy values.  The bug arises from the way loose comparisons work, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

## The Bug

The `foo` function attempts to differentiate between null, undefined, and other values. However, due to loose comparison, values like 0 and false are also considered falsy and will not trigger the expected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons, avoiding unexpected matches. The improved function makes use of strict equality to correctly identify null and undefined and handle other values appropriately.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
4. Run the files in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, browser console) and observe the differences in output.
